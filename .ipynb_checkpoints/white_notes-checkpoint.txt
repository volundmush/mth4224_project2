Standard scaler:

1. Min-max will scale values to always be between 0 and 1. But, the data organizing as lines in PCA doesn't make sense. Should drill down and determine where the lines come from.

2. Do DBSCAN clustering and then get basic summary statistics about each cluster. And also in each cluster, there may be a higher amount of phishing than non-phishing. Any understanding of the summary statistics is valuable to show. As long as a higher percentage than the whole dataset, then this is a relevant cluster.

3. One way to remove columns: each component of PCA is a linear combination of features (x*f1 + y*f2 + ...). So, look at what features are weighted most heavily for each PCA component (called PCA loadings). This could be used to remove the features that aren't relevant; PCA seems to extract what is important. You could do a bar graph of the different coefficients for the different features in each component.

We can submit a report detailing what to do by Wednesday on Monday. Then, afterwards submit a completed report with all diagrams.
